# AI Guidelines for SWIMI Landing Page Project

## Context
This project is a landing page generator for an "École de bébés nageurs" (Baby Swimmers School) with 7 swimming pools. The goal is to generate various landing pages for different pool locations or services.

## General Rules

1. **Maintain Project Structure**: Follow the existing component-based architecture.
2. **Language Priorities**: 
   - French is the primary language for user-facing content
   - English is acceptable for code comments and variable names
3. **Brand Identity**: Maintain a friendly, professional tone that appeals to parents of young children
4. **Mobile-First**: Ensure all modifications maintain mobile responsiveness
5. **Accessibility**: Maintain A11Y standards throughout the project

## Component Modifications

When modifying components:
1. Keep the Shadcn/Tailwind design system intact
2. Maintain dark/light mode functionality
3. Follow existing naming conventions for components
4. Preserve React component patterns (functional components with hooks)

## Content Guidelines

1. **Baby Swimming Focus**: All content should relate to baby swimming activities
2. **Parent-Oriented**: Content should address parents' concerns and needs
3. **Safety First**: Emphasize safety aspects of the swimming programs
4. **Developmental Benefits**: Highlight developmental benefits of baby swimming
5. **Location-Specific**: When creating location-specific pages, include:
   - Address and directions
   - Pool specifications
   - Available class times
   - Specific amenities

## Technical Constraints

1. Keep bundle size minimal by reusing existing components
2. Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary
3. Maintain TypeScript type safety
4. Ensure all components use the theme provider for styling
5. Follow the existing folder structure

## Deployment Considerations

When preparing for deployment:
1. Optimize images for web

3. Verify all links work correctly
4. Test across multiple browsers and devices
